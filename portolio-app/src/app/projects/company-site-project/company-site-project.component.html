          For an upper division web development course my group and I were asked to design and develop an ecommerce site
          for a fictional company. Our company, Creation Station, was a makerspace company that runs classes and rents
          high-end tools to empower its patrons to create.

          Starting out we compared existing sites from our previous week of work in order to form the basis of our site.
          My initial site was more developed and technically sound so we decided to use it as our basis while adding in
          design aspects from the other two sites. Using atomic design principles we proceeded to develop some initial
          site components and templates along with a site map to guide development.

          Our proposed solution was a game-rental service, similar to Gamefly and Game Access, which would allow EB
          games
          to leverage existing assets, namely their large inventory, international status, and brick-and-mortar stores,
          to
          generate additional revenue.

          During our first round of peer feedback we discovered that our site had issues in terms of responsiveness
          causing certain images/ui elements to become too large/distracting. In order to correct this we elected to add
          an expanding margin space to limit the size of our content. This helped keep our content centered and more
          usable as well as more aesthetically pleasing on larger screens.

          During our final round of critique we discovered several issues in non-chrome based browsers. With IE being
          the worst offender by far, content would tend to spill over the boundaries of divs/sections and make the site
          less professional looking if not unusable. Through further investigation and css tweaking we were able to
          remove most if not all of these issues in order to get our site to its more finalized and polished state.
