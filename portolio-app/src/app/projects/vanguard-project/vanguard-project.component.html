            Vanguard rental service for EB games.

          EB games was losing profit from their primary source of revenue: the buying and selling
          of physical games due to increasing popularity of digital
          distribution and alternative vendors such as Steam or Amazon.

          Our proposed solution was a game-rental service which would allow EB
          games
          to leverage existing assets, namely their large inventory, international status, and brick-and-mortar stores,
          to
          generate additional revenue.

          In our first attempt in designing our digital platform we used Gamefly, Google Play Music, and Steam as basis
          for
          our UI. The site was functional but we felt it was too generic to differentiate us from the competition.

          A diamond motif, inspired by the button layout found on Playstation and Xbox controllers, was implemented
          throughout our site to guide both the visual aesthetic of our site and navigation of the site,
          which was broken up into 4 different quadrants that could be navigated using the arrow keys.

          We also made an effort to resolve pain points we discovered in our competitions’ sites and services, namely
          providing feedback for when games had been added to a customer’s rental queue and providing a more tangible
          metric that customers could use to judge whether a game was available for rental or not. However, our UI felt
          inconsistent across our channels, with the console and mobile channels in particular feeling fairly generic
          and missing our diamond aesthetic.

          In our most recent attempt we managed to better leverage our metaphor into both the console and mobile
          channels. This made our apps/site feel more cohesive as a whole. However we feel there is still room for
          improvement, especially concerning the game details page on our website, which at the moment acts as a pop-up
          and detracts from the overall composition when contrasted to the rest of the UI.
